###Exercise 13: Switch Statement

Remember a few simple rules:
* Always include a default: branch so that you catch any missing inputs.
* Don't allow "fall through" unless you really want it, and it's a good idea to add a comment //fallthrough so people know it's on purpose.
* Always write the case and the break before you write the code that goes in it.
* Try to just use if-statements instead if you can.
